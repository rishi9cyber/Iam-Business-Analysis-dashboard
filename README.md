# IAM Business Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a **dashboard** for analyzing **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** metrics, such as user access requests, role assignments, and compliance reports. It uses **Python** and **Dash/Plotly** for data visualization.

## Key Features
- **User Access Tracking**: Monitor user access requests and permissions.
- **Role Assignment Analysis**: Visualize role assignments and their impact.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance reports for auditing purposes.

## Use Cases
- Enterprise environments requiring IAM metrics visualization.
- Organizations looking to improve access management and compliance.
- Compliance with security standards like GDPR and HIPAA.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Dash/Plotly**: For building interactive dashboards.
- **CSV Files**: For storing sample IAM data.

## How It Works
1. The dashboard reads IAM data from a CSV file.
2. It visualizes user access requests, role assignments, and compliance metrics.
3. Users can interact with the dashboard to explore the data.

## Code Examples

### Python Code (Dash/Plotly Dashboard)
```python
import dash
from dash import dcc, html
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Load sample IAM data
data = pd.read_csv('iam-data.csv')

# Initialize Dash app
app = dash.Dash(__name__)

# Define layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1("IAM Business Analysis Dashboard"),
    dcc.Graph(
        id='access-requests-chart',
        figure=px.bar(data, x='User', y='AccessRequests', title="Access Requests by User")
    ),
    dcc.Graph(
        id='role-assignments-chart',
        figure=px.pie(data, names='Role', title="Role Assignments")
    )
])

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
